ROUNDS:

🔁 Round 1 – Immediate Counterarguments
🧑‍⚖️ Plaintiff Argument

The car was serviced only at the company’s authorized service center.
No external modifications were ever made.
The failure occurred well within the warranty period, which clearly includes engine defects.

🏢 Defendant Argument

The service record indicates the use of non-genuine engine oil, not supplied or recommended by ABC Motors.
This constitutes a form of modification affecting performance and voiding warranty terms.

🔁 Round 2 – Technical Evidence
🧑‍⚖️ Plaintiff Argument

The engine oil used was Castrol Edge, which is ISO-certified and compatible with the model.
The service invoice clearly mentions that oil replacement was performed at the authorized center.

🏢 Defendant Argument

Even if compatible, only ABC-approved oil ensures compliance with the manufacturer’s warranty.
The service team noted sludge deposits consistent with improper lubrication.

🔁 Round 3 – Warranty & Responsibility
🧑‍⚖️ Plaintiff Argument

The warranty booklet does not mention any restriction on brand of engine oil, only quality grade (5W-40).
Therefore, ABC Motors cannot arbitrarily reject warranty coverage.

🏢 Defendant Argument

The booklet explicitly states “maintenance as per manufacturer’s recommendations.”
The plaintiff failed to consult the dealer before changing oil brands, breaching warranty terms.

🔁 Round 4 – Customer Service Conduct
🧑‍⚖️ Plaintiff Argument

Despite multiple complaints, ABC Motors failed to offer inspection or resolution for over 45 days.
This delay itself constitutes deficiency in service.

🏢 Defendant Argument

The company offered a free inspection on April 18, 2023, but the plaintiff did not bring the car to the workshop.
Delay occurred due to non-cooperation from the customer.


🔁 Round 5 – Final Appeals
🧑‍⚖️ Plaintiff Argument

The company’s refusal and delay forced the plaintiff to use alternative transport, causing financial and mental distress.
Compensation is justified for both monetary and non-monetary loss.

🏢 Defendant Argument

Compensation claims are excessive and unsupported by documentation.
The plaintiff cannot claim both full refund and separate compensation simultaneously.
